	<h1>The FizzBuzz Refactor Challenge</h1>
	<p>In the original <em>FizzBuzz Challenge</em>, I created a program that for each number from 1 to 100, if it was not not divisible by 3 or 5, printed the number. If it was divisible by 3, the program printed “fizz”. If it’ was divisible by 5, the program printed “buzz”. And finally, if it was divisible by both 3 and 5, the program printed “fizz buzz”.</p>
	<p>For the <em>FizzBuzz Refactor Challenge</em>, I created a program that did those same things, but used functions instead of loops and prompted the user to enter a max value for the program. Click the red button below to begin. Then, click "New Game" to start fresh.</p>
